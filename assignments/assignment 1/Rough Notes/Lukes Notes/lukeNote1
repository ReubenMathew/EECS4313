-There is a problem in the memo section specifically the  ctrl+f function
If you enter some text, say "this is some text" and you place the cursor after "is", ctrl +F wont
find things that you search for  before and including  "is"

-go into week view and right click "quick todo" and write some text. It will apear in the top box
of the screen, below the date and above where the time table starts. Then drag that text down
to the time table. Youll notice that regardless of the size of the text, it will get 
smushed down to a thin black line from margin to margin. Then, if you can, try and resize the 
black line to expose the text. Ive noticed that sometimes it bugs out.
