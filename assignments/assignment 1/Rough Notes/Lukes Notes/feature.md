### Things to consider in a bug report
- Is the summary short (about 50-70 characters) and descriptive?
- Can a developer understand the bug report? Is there sufficient detail to envision what the
program did in response? Is it clear what the failure was?
- Is it obvious where to start (what state to bring the program to) to replicate the bug?
- Is it obvious what files to use (if any)? Is it obvious what you would type?
- Is the replication sequence provided as a numbered set of steps, which tell developer exactly
what to do and, when useful, what developer will see?
- Does your bug report include unnecessary information, personal opinions or anecdotes that seem
out of place?
- Is the bug report too long? Too short? Does it have a lot of unnecessary steps?
- Can you replicate the bug by following your steps?
- Can developer get lost or wonder whether you had done a step correctly? Would additional
feedback, e.g. “the program will respond like this ...”, have helped?
- Does configuration or environment change have an effect on bug reproduction?
