# Appendix A – Report Format
<!-- Your report should be single space 12 point font. Each of the bug report should include the following information: -->
## Bug Report Title:
<!-- About 3 to 10 words making clear what your bug report is about. -->
### Reported by:
<!-- The bug reporter’s name and contact information. -->
### Date reported:
<!-- The date when this bug report is filed. -->
### Program (or component) name:
<!-- Which program/component has issue? -->
### Configuration(s):
<!-- The hardware and software configurations under which the bug was found and replicated. -->
### Report type:
<!-- Is this a bug (e.g., coding error, design issue or documentation mismatch) or feature enhancement? -->
### Reproducibility:
<!-- Yes / no / sometimes / unknown. For no/sometimes, provide as much information as you can. -->
### Severity:
<!-- Is this a major issue or a minor issue? -->
### Problem summary:
<!-- A short summary of the problem -->
### Problem description:
<!-- Describe the problem and the steps to reproduce the problem. -->
### wNew or old bug:
<!-- Is this a new bug or an existing unfixed bug? -->

### Things to consider in a bug report
- Is the summary short (about 50-70 characters) and descriptive?
- Can a developer understand the bug report? Is there sufficient detail to envision what the
program did in response? Is it clear what the failure was?
- Is it obvious where to start (what state to bring the program to) to replicate the bug?
- Is it obvious what files to use (if any)? Is it obvious what you would type?
- Is the replication sequence provided as a numbered set of steps, which tell developer exactly
what to do and, when useful, what developer will see?
- Does your bug report include unnecessary information, personal opinions or anecdotes that seem
out of place?
- Is the bug report too long? Too short? Does it have a lot of unnecessary steps?
- Can you replicate the bug by following your steps?
- Can developer get lost or wonder whether you had done a step correctly? Would additional
feedback, e.g. “the program will respond like this ...”, have helped?
- Does configuration or environment change have an effect on bug reproduction?
